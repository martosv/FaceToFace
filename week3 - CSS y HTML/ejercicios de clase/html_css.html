            <p>To start with, the thing most often said of Nicolas Cage: he is weird-looking, with constituent parts that don't promise to add up to a movie star. His hair, like cultivated grassland, is lush at the top and sparse at the root. There is something puppety about his face. And, of course, there are his eyes, which, like the Woody Allen joke – "You have the most eyes I've ever seen on any person" – qualify him to play both romantic leads and psychopaths. At 49, Cage overturns every industry standard, and there's no denying it: the result is transfixing. "Have a blueberry muffin," he says in that agonised drawl, and flashes a goofy grin.</p>

            <p>We are in a hotel in Mobile, Alabama, a small town on the Gulf Coast where he and Danny Glover are filming an action movie called Tokarev, in which Cage plays a reformed mobster reluctantly returning to his violent roots when his daughter is kidnapped. (The day before, they filmed a car chase down the main street and the excitement still ripples through the glutinous air.) It sounds like a classic Cage role, not that he allows for the existence of such a thing. Cage is methodical in rebutting preconceived notions about himself. "There is a misperception, if you will, in critical response or even in Hollywood, that I can only do exaggerated characters. Or what they would call over-the-top performances." He pauses, as if issuing an historic statement from the podium: "Well, this is completely false."</p>
